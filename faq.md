Frequently asked questions
----------------------

> Who can participate ?

Any ug or pg student enrolled in any college.

> Why OpenCode ?

It is an initiative by FOSS IIITA to make students familiar with opensource and development. It can be seen as a mini Google Summer of Code. This event will be held on github.

As Richard Feynman once said "What I cannot create, I do not understand". We hope you will understand things as you create things throught the event.

> Are there any prerequisites to participate ?

You dont have to know anything beforehand. We expect you to learn things as you progress through the event. We will have simple to complex bugs. When you finish the event we assure you that you will be familiar with the basics of opensource contributions.

As the event is on github, a good way to start is to start using git. Even though the first few issues can be solved without using the terminal version of git, we recommend you to use the terminal version as it will be useful in the future. But learn as you grow.

> Where do i start?

You can start by solving the issues with the label opencode.

> Will there be more projects?

Yes, as the event progresses the number of projects will increase. So we suggest you put watch on all the repositories with the label OpenCode, as well as follow our [facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/Opencode-1038106262984513/).

> How long is the event?

It is a month long event starting from 17 January 2017.

> Can anyone be a mentor ?

Yes, anyone can be a Mentor. You can fill the form you dont necessarily have to be from iiita. Selections will be made based on your GitHub profile. However, you will be made a member only in the later stage as the number of projects increase.

> Will more projects will be added ?

Yes. As the number of participants increase you can expect more projects and more issues.

> I am stuck. What should i do ?

You can start by googling the problem. However, if you're facing problems even after a few tries, please contact anyone who is a mentor or an Organizer either via their facebook account or [Connect on Gitter](https://gitter.im/opencode2017). Feel free to disturb us. We are always here to help!
